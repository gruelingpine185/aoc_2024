# Day 3

Day 1 and 2 were my favorite and least favorite languages. I've decided that 
today is going to be a bit more experimental. In fact, today uses not a 
programming language, but a text editor entitled [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/).

## Building & Running

Navigate to `./aoc_2024/days/03/`. Once there, you may painstakenly insert the 
commands into Helix manually and see the works of your poor hands come to life.

```bash
hx --vsplit tmp.txt day3.hx
```
