# Day 1

For the first day of the event, I'll be using C. It happens to be my most used 
language since Covid and by far my favorite thus far.

## Building & Running

Navigate to `./aoc_2024/days/01/`. Once there, you may build and run via the 
following commands. Any C compiler can be used in place of Clang.

```bash
clang -std=c11 main.c -o day1
./day1 ./input.txt
```
