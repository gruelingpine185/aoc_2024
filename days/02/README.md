# Day 2

Today's language is by far my least favorite of all the languages I've used. 
The indentation is forced, the language is slow, yet it remains adored by the 
people... Enter Python!

## Building & Running

Navigate to `./aoc_2024/days/02/`. Once there, you may build and run via the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x ./day2.py
./day2.py ./input.txt
```
