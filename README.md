# Advent of Code 2024

It's that time of year again and AoC is kicking off to a great start! These are 
my quick and dirty solutions for 2024's puzzles, so don't judge too harshly. 
Remember, push to main, but push your limits first :)

## Execution Via [Slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides)

Clone the repo with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gruelingpine185/aoc_2024
```

If you have the Slides program installed, you may view README.md files within 
each subdirectory of `./days/` directly from the terminal.

Code blocks may be executed directly within Slides with `<C-e>` -- that is, 
`Control + e` --, which will build, run, and embed my solutions into the 
commands nto the slides.

## Progress

| Day | Language | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2 | - | - | - | 
| [01](./days/01) | C | done | done | 


*Note to self: The script needs some adjustments to download the prompt for 
part 2. Only use it for input rn.*
